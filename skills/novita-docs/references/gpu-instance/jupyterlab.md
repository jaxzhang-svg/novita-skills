Jupyter Lab is an interactive notebook that supports over 40 programming languages. Jupyter Lab is an open-source web application that facilitates the creation and sharing of literate programming documents, supporting real-time code execution, mathematical equations, visualizations, and markdown editing.The official templates of GPU instance come with a pre-installed Jupyter Lab environment. To enable this feature, please checkout the **“Start Jupyter Notebook”** option when deploying the instance.

Some official templates may not support the Jupyter Lab environment. If you have specific requirements, please reach out to us through the [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/YyPRAzwp7P).
