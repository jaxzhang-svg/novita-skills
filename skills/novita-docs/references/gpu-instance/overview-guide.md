- [Terminology](https://novita.ai/docs/guides/gpu-instance-overview#terminology)

**GPU Instance** provides cost-effective, accessible high-performance computing with easy GPU access, making it ideal for complex AI tasks. Users benefit from on-demand rental, optimizing both efficiency and cost-effectiveness.

## [​](https://novita.ai/docs/guides/gpu-instance-overview\#features)  Features

- Rich **built-in templates** help you quickly deploy GPU instances for AI tasks out of the box;
- Start a GPU instance **in seconds**, helping you quickly handle traffic peaks;
- Provides nodes in **multiple global regions** to deploy GPUs closer to your users for minimal latency;
- Provides **free local storage** and allows you to attach network volume, also provides free network transfer;
- Billing is **accurate to the second**, charging only for the actual running time of the GPU container instances;
- **Affordable pricing** save costs by up to 50%.

## [​](https://novita.ai/docs/guides/gpu-instance-overview\#terminology)  Terminology

- **Container Image**: Docker-compatible OCI image reference, supporting both public registries and private repositories with authentication.
- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration key-value pairs injected into containers for dynamic configuration and secrets management.
- **HTTP/TCP Ports**: Network endpoints exposed by containers for communication. HTTP ports (e.g., 80, 443) for web services, TCP ports for general network protocols.
- **Container Disk**: Root filesystem partition containing OS and system binaries. Mounted as read-write at container startup.
- **Volume Disk**: High-performance ephemeral storage directly attached to the GPU instance. Optimized for I/O intensive workloads but non-persistent across instance restarts.
- **Network Volume**: Network-attached storage service that allows users to access and manage data through a network. Data can be stored on remote servers and accessed from any device.
