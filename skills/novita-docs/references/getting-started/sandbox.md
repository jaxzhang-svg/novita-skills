# Let your   AI Agents run   for real

Agent Sandbox is a secure, fast, and programmable runtime designed for real-world AI Agent execution.

[Get Started](https://novita.ai/sandbox-console) [Pricing](https://novita.ai/pricing?sandbox=1)

### Millisecond-Level Startup

Sandbox instances launch in under 200 ms on average — optimized for high-frequency and concurrent workloads.

### Secure Isolation

Each task runs in a fully isolated environment with system-level separation to prevent data leakage and unauthorized access.

### High Concurrency

Run thousands of sandbox instances in parallel with consistently low latency — ideal for real-time, high-throughput workloads.
