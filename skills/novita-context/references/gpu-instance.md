## Features

- **Built-in templates** help you quickly deploy GPU instances for AI tasks out of the box
- Start a GPU instance **in seconds**, helping you quickly handle traffic peaks
- Provides nodes in **multiple global regions** to deploy GPUs closer to users for minimal latency
- Provides **free local storage** and allows you to attach network volume, also provides free network transfer
- Billing is **accurate to the second**, charging only for actual running time
- **Affordable pricing** - save costs by up to 50%

## Terminology

- **Container Image**: Docker-compatible OCI image reference, supporting both public registries and private repositories with authentication
- **Environment Variables**: Runtime configuration key-value pairs injected into containers for dynamic configuration and secrets management
- **HTTP/TCP Ports**: Network endpoints exposed by containers for communication (HTTP ports for web services, TCP ports for general network protocols)
- **Container Disk**: Root filesystem partition containing OS and system binaries, mounted as read-write at container startup
- **Volume Disk**: High-performance ephemeral storage directly attached to GPU instance, optimized for I/O intensive workloads but non-persistent across instance restarts
- **Network Volume**: Network-attached storage service that allows users to access and manage data through a network. Data can be stored on remote servers and accessed from any device
